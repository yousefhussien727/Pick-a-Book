# "Pick-a-Book" Web Application Demo
> An Online Used Bookstore Application that facilitates the trading of used books between users, in which the customer has an account containing personal details that allows them to sell or buy books, search for books, and display a list of categories that contain books that might interest them.


## System Model ✨

#### 🔹 System Service Model: *Software as a Service (SaaS)*
> The SaaS service best suits the needs of the developed application as it runs directly through a web browser (a thin client) as the service requires both web and mobile access.
#### 🔹 System Deployment Model: *Public Cloud Deployment Model*
> This application follows the public cloud deployment model as it is provisioned for general use and any customer can easily view all books, and by creating an account users can access all system services such as buying and selling used books. The public model also helps the service grow faster because it draws in a large pool of users.
